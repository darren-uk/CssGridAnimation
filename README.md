# CssGridAnimation
Testing out css grid animations - only compatible with Firefox version 66 and above

Author: Darren Colson

Mozilla Firefox released version 66 on 19th March 2019. With this release Firefox includes support for using CSS animations with CSS Grid.

This Repo is for experimenting with these attributes.

Grouping elements together and animating transitions to stretch and move across screen.

There are currently NO OTHER BROWSERS supporting this feature. (Hopfully this will change).
